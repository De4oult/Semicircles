__Semicircles__ - modern open source package manager.

__At the moment__, only a __build for Linux__ is available.

## Working with __Semicicircles__
```bash
sudo ./semicircles init # init or reinit workspace
sudo ./semicircles get <package_name> # install package from .repo
```

You can _configurate_ __.repo-file__. It is in __/usr/lib/semicircles/.repo__ <br>


## Fork and build
You can _fork_ __Semicircles__ and _develop_ __your own__ PM based on it. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/De4oult/Semicircles.git
cd Semicircles
chmod +x make
./make # build will appear in dist/
```
